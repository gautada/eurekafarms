# Plan-README Execution Protocol

When Adam tags a repo with the `plan-readme` topic, I go into "README planner" mode. This document is my playbook so I can drop in, create/update a planning branch, and hand Adam a Ready-to-review PR + project item with zero loose ends.

---

## 0. Prereqs
- `gh` CLI authenticated with `GITHUB_PA_PLAN_TOKEN`.
- Push access to all `gautada/*` repos (already granted).
- URL for the **Eureka FARMS** project board (https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2/views/3).

---

## 1. Discover active repos
1. List every repo carrying the `plan-readme` topic:
   ```bash
   gh repo list gautada --topic plan-readme --json nameWithOwner,description,sshUrl --limit 200
   ```
2. If the command returns an empty array, stop — there is no work.
3. Otherwise, process each repo in alphabetical order (oldest untouched first if timestamps available).

Document progress in `notes.md` inside each plan branch.

---

## 2. Hydrate the repo
For each repo identified above:
1. Clone if needed: `git clone <repo-url>`.
2. `cd <repo>` and `git fetch --all --prune`.
3. Inspect remote branches: `git branch -r`.

---

## 3. Ensure `dev` baseline
1. Check if `origin/dev` exists.
2. If **yes**: `git checkout dev && git pull`.
3. If **no**: create it from `main` (or default) and push:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev origin/main
   git push -u origin dev
   ```

All plan work starts from the latest `dev` branch.

---

## 4. Create a planning branch
1. Choose a slug that reflects the change, e.g. `plan/readme-refresh`, `plan/platform-docs`, etc.
2. `git checkout -b plan/<slug> origin/dev`.
3. Create `notes.md` (if missing) and capture:
   - Repo state summary
   - Branch inventory & stale items
   - Issue audit takeaways
   - README gaps + proposed fixes

---

## 5. Audit & update README
Run this checklist for every README in the repo (root + major subdirs):

| Section | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Explain purpose, owner, and current status. Keep the first paragraph under 80 words. |
| Architecture | Link to diagrams or describe key services/components. |
| Environments | Document dev/stage/prod URLs and login notes. |
| Setup | Step-by-step bootstrap instructions (dependencies, env vars, local run commands). |
| Operations | How to deploy, run tests, restart services, rotate secrets. |
| Planning hooks | List open issues/epics relevant to this repo, plus link to the active plan branch. |
| Contact | Point-of-contact (Adam/Nyx/blair) and escalation path. |

Rules:
- Use tables or callouts when it improves scanability.
- Assume Nyx is the reader: no fluff, no TODO placeholders.
- Keep instructions repo-specific — no generic “TBD”.
- If work spans multiple files (e.g., `/docs/README.md`), fix them in the same branch.

---

## 6. Git hygiene
1. `git status` should show only intended README/docs/notes changes.
2. Format Markdown (`markdownlint` if configured) and spell-check critical names.
3. Commit message format: `chore: refresh README plan context` (tweak verb as needed).

---

## 7. Push & open PR
1. `git push -u origin plan/<slug>`.
2. Open a PR targeting `dev`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --base dev \
     --head plan/<slug> \
     --title "Plan: <short summary>" \
     --body "See notes in /cohort/plan for context." \
     --assignee @gautada
   ```
3. Include checklist items in the PR body if multiple READMEs changed.

---

## 8. Project tracking
For each PR:
1. Open the **Eureka FARMS** project board.
2. Create a new item under "Ready" with:
   - **Title:** `Review README plan for <repo>`
   - **Assignee:** Adam
   - **Status:** Ready
   - **Body:** Link to the PR + summary of what changed.

---

## 9. Hand-off
1. DM Adam (or comment on the PR) with:
   - Link to the PR
   - Link to the project item
   - One-paragraph summary + any blocking questions
2. Remove the `plan-readme` topic on the repo.

---

**Definition of Done**
- Every `plan-readme` repo has an up-to-date README that satisfies the checklist above.
- A plan branch exists off `dev` with the documentation changes.
- PR assigned to Adam + matching Eureka FARMS project item in "Ready".
