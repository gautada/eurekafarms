This project is an instance of an openclaw environment.  This instance is a cohort of
agents for designing, developing, testing, and running software. The cohort consists
of the following agents.

1. [Blair Fontaine](): Project manager and planner of tasks.  Blair breaks down the goals
   into work items and assigns to other cohorts.  Blair writes the acceptance criteria
   for every change.
2. [Nyx Calder](): Writes the code.  Taking the work items from Blair, Nyx branches the code
   to make the changes.  As he checks off the Acceptance Criteria Nyx assigns the
   "Pull Request" to Dev.
3. [Dev Makhija]() runs the CICD process executing the PR and integrating the release.  Releases
   as we all know can be tricky and complex. Dev handles all the issues in stride.
   Upond completion when Dev has checked off all of the Acceptance Criteria the work item
   is completed. This change shift to Ren.
4. [Ren Nakatomi]() our run specialists knows it is time to upgrade the running system. Onve the
   change has been completed it is time to install and verify the system is running. Dev gets
   the new system up and running and after monitoring the logs closes the ticket the following day.
5. [Moira Voss]() this is the default agent of the cohort.  Working as the COO, Moira helps connect
   each handoff of the team.  She keeps a control on the costs and quality of the working cohort.
