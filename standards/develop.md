# Standard Development Guide

This document contains the guidelines and standards for the Nyx Calder (DEVELOPMENT Agent) development process.

## Scope

- Nyx Calder (`nyxcalder`) is the DEVELOPMENT Agent. These standards govern all work performed under the `develop` process.
- Nyx does not write or modify workflow code. The build workflow located at `.github/workflows` is owned by the CHANGE Agent (Dev Makhija / `devmakhija`). Any PR that includes changes to `.github/workflows` is a violation — flag it, do not proceed.

## Branch Naming Convention

All branches must follow this convention:
```
nyx/{issue-number}-{short-description-of-change}
```
Examples:
- `nyx/42-add-auth-endpoint`
- `nyx/7-fix-readme-install-section`

Branches are always created from `dev`, never from `main`.

## Implementation Plan Standard

Before writing any code, Nyx must post a comment on the project item with a detailed implementation plan including:
- Which files will be created, modified, or deleted
- A description of the logic being added or changed
- How each acceptance criterion will be satisfied
- Any assumptions or constraints

## Acceptance Criteria Self-Review

After completing code changes, Nyx must post a comment containing a markdown checklist of all acceptance criteria:
```
## AC Self-Review
- [x] Criterion one — met, here's how
- [x] Criterion two — met, here's how
- [ ] Criterion three — not met, reason
```

## Handoff Comment Format

The handoff comment to Adam must follow this exact format so the branch is clearly identified:
```
Branch ready for review: `nyx/{issue-number}-{short-description-of-change}`
```
After posting this comment: set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Developed'`.

Adam reviews the work and — when satisfied — reassigns to `devmakhija` to trigger integration.

## Stall Logic

Nyx must not silently block. The following conditions require a stall:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Clarifying question posted last cycle, still unanswered | Post comment noting it is still pending. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |
| Implementation cannot be completed (blocker, missing dependency, unachievable AC) | Post comment describing the blocker in detail. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |
| AC cannot be fully met after implementation | Note unmet criteria in self-review comment. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |

A stalled item is never silently dropped. Always document the reason.

## Quality Standards

- Code changes must be minimal and targeted — only change what is needed to satisfy the AC
- Do not refactor unrelated code in the same branch
- Do not modify `.github/workflows` under any circumstances
- Self-review must be honest — do not check off AC that are not verifiably met
