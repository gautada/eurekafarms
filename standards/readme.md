# Standard README.md

This document defines the required structure and content standards for every `README.md` across all repositories maintained by the eureka!FARMS cohort.

---

## Why This Matters

A README is the contract between a project and everyone who will ever use, operate, or extend it. An incomplete or misleading README creates confusion, breaks deployments, and wastes time. The goal is not length — it's that a team member with no prior context can read the README and be productive within 15 minutes.

---

## Required Section Order

Every `README.md` **MUST** follow this exact section order. Sections may not be omitted but may be marked not applicable. The order must never change.

1. Title
2. Description
3. Table of Contents
4. Abstract
5. Features
6. Build
7. Install
8. Run
9. Contributing
10. Links
11. License

## Section Guidance

---

### 1. Title

**What it is:** A single `# H1` heading — the name of the project.

**Rules:**
- Match the GitHub repository name exactly (e.g. `alpine`, not `Alpine Container`).
- One `# H1` only. No subtitle in the heading line.
- Do not include the org prefix (`gautada/`) — that's GitHub's job.

**Template:**
```markdown
# alpine
```

**Avoid:**
- `# gautada/alpine` — includes org prefix
- `# Alpine Base Container for Kubernetes` — editorializing in the title

---

### 2. Description

**What it is:** A single sentence directly under the title, in italics, describing what the project is.

**Rules:**
- One sentence. Hard limit.
- No period at the end.
- Plain English — assume the reader has never heard of this project.
- Describe **what it is**, not how it works.
- Should match or closely mirror the GitHub repository description field.

**Template:**
```markdown
*Alpine Linux base container image for all eureka!FARMS downstream services*
```

**Good:**
> *Debian bookworm-slim base container with s6 init, health checks, and backup scaffolding*

**Bad:**
> *This container is built on alpine:3.22 and uses s6 as its process supervisor, and it also includes some utilities*

That's a how, not a what — and it's two sentences.

---

### 3. Table of Contents

**What it is:** An anchor-linked list of every section in the README.

**Rules:**
- Required for all READMEs (all repos in this fleet qualify).
- Must follow the standard section order.
- Use GitHub-compatible anchor syntax: lowercase, spaces become `-`, punctuation dropped.
- Omit only sections explicitly marked not applicable.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Abstract](#abstract)
- [Features](#features)
- [Build](#build)
- [Install](#install)
- [Run](#run)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Links](#links)
- [License](#license)
```

---

### 4. Abstract

**What it is:** A prose explanation of the project — what it does, why it exists, who it serves, and what it does not do.

**Rules:**
- 2–5 paragraphs. Not a bullet list.
- Answer four questions: What is it? Why does it exist? Who uses it? What doesn't it do?
- Reference upstream projects by name and link.
- Keep it honest — document current state, not aspirational state.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Abstract

`alpine` is the foundation layer for every container in the eureka!FARMS fleet.
It extends the official [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) image with a
standardized init pattern, volume layout, health probe scaffolding, and privilege
conventions that every downstream container relies on.

This image is not intended for direct deployment. It exists so that downstream
container authors start from a known, tested, consistent base rather than
reinventing init and health check logic in every repo.

Out of scope: application-specific configuration, service definitions, or
business logic. Those belong in downstream images.
```

---

### 5. Features

**What it is:** A concise bulleted list of what this project provides.

**Rules:**
- Bullets only. No paragraphs, no nested sub-bullets.
- Max 10 items. More than 10 means you're listing implementation details, not features.
- Start each bullet with a noun or verb. Be specific.
- Focus on outcomes for the user or operator, not implementation choices.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Features

- Standardized volume layout (`/mnt/volumes/{data,configmaps,backup,secrets}`)
- s6-based process supervision with drop-in service definitions
- Health probe fan-out (`liveness`, `readiness`, `startup`, `test` via single script)
- Hourly backup hook with override contract for downstream containers
- Least-privilege user model with `privileged` group and sudoers scaffolding
- UTC-configurable timezone (default: `America/New_York`)
```

**Bad:**
> - Uses Alpine Linux 3.22
> - Has a Containerfile
> - Installs packages

Those are implementation facts, not features.

---

### 6. Build

**What it is:** Step-by-step instructions to build the container image locally.

**Rules:**
- Every command must be copy-pasteable as written.
- Include all required build args with their defaults shown.
- Show the exact `podman build` command used in CI so local and CI builds match.
- State any prerequisites explicitly — do not assume.
- Do not skip steps because they seem obvious.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Build

**Prerequisites:** Podman 5+, internet access (pulls from Alpine mirrors)

```bash
# Standard build
podman build -t gautada/alpine:dev .

# Build with custom user
podman build \
  --build-arg USER=myapp \
  --build-arg UID=1000 \
  --build-arg GID=1000 \
  -t gautada/alpine:dev .

# Verify the built version
podman run --rm gautada/alpine:dev /usr/bin/container-version
```
```

---

### 7. Install

**What it is:** Instructions for deploying the container into the target environment (Kubernetes / MicroK8s).

**Rules:**
- This section is about deployment, not development setup.
- Show the exact commands to apply manifests or deploy the image.
- Include verification steps — how does the operator know the install succeeded?
- Reference required secrets and configmaps by name, never by value.
- If this image is not deployed directly (e.g. a base image), say so explicitly.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Install

> **Note:** `alpine` is a base image and is not deployed directly. See downstream
> containers for deployment instructions.
```

*For a deployable service:*
```markdown
## Install

```bash
# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Verify the pod is running
kubectl get pods -l app=postgresql

# Verify health checks pass
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=postgresql -o name) \
  -- /usr/bin/container-health
```

**Required secrets** (must exist in the namespace before deployment):
| Secret name | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgresql-secret` | `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database superuser password |
```
```

---

### 8. Run

**What it is:** How to run the container locally for development or ad-hoc use.

**Rules:**
- Cover the most common use case first.
- Include the interactive shell invocation — always useful for debugging.
- Show volume mount conventions.
- Show how to exec into a running container.
- Note any external service dependencies.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Run

```bash
# Run with interactive shell
podman run --rm -it gautada/alpine:dev /bin/zsh

# Run with standard volumes mounted
podman run -d --name alpine \
  -v ./data:/mnt/volumes/data \
  -v ./config:/mnt/volumes/configmaps:ro \
  -v ./secrets:/mnt/volumes/secrets:ro \
  -v ./backup:/mnt/volumes/backup \
  gautada/alpine:dev

# Exec into a running container
podman exec -it alpine /bin/zsh

# Check health
podman exec alpine /usr/bin/container-health
```
```

---

### 9. Contributing

**What it is:** Instructions for how a contributor submits a change.

**Rules:**
- Every repo gets a Contributing section — it is never omitted.
- Document the branch model: `dev` is the integration branch; `main` tracks releases.
- Describe the PR process and what CI must pass.
- This project is actively developed and maintained by AI agents — reflect that.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Contributing

All changes flow through `dev` before merging to `main`. This repository is
actively maintained by the [eureka!FARMS](https://github.com/gautada) AI cohort.

**Branch naming:**
| Type | Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature / fix | `{agent}/{issue-number}-{description}` | `nyx/42-add-auth-endpoint` |
| Documentation | `{agent}/{issue-number}-{description}` | `nyx/7-update-readme` |

**Process:**
1. Branch from `dev`.
2. Make your changes and test locally.
3. Push and open a PR targeting `dev`.
4. CI must pass before merge.
5. Changes to `main` happen on release only.
```

---

### 10. Links

**What it is:** A curated list of external references relevant to this project.

**Rules:**
- Include: upstream project, Docker Hub page, GitHub repo (if a mirror or fork), and relevant docs.
- Do not include internal Slack links, local IP addresses, or credentials.
- Keep it short — 4–8 links max.
- Dead links are worse than no links. Verify them when updating.

**Template:**
```markdown
## Links

- [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) — upstream OS
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gautada/alpine) — published images
- [GitHub](https://github.com/gautada/alpine) — source
- [s6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) — init system reference
- [eureka!FARMS Project Board](https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2) — active work
```

---

### 11. License

**What it is:** The license governing use and distribution of this project.

**Rules:**
- One line, linking to the `LICENSE` file in the repo.
- Include the license type in the text.
- If the project wraps upstream software, note the upstream license and link.
- If the upstream license cannot be determined, open a bug assigned to Adam.
- When no upstream project exists, use the most permissive open source license available.

**Template:**
```markdown
## License

[MIT](./LICENSE) — upstream [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/about/) is licensed separately.
```

---

## Omission Rules

Some sections may not apply to every repo. Use this table:

| Section | May omit when... |
| --- | --- |
| Table of Contents | README is under 30 lines (rare) |
| Build | Image is not built from source in this repo |
| Install | Base image not deployed directly |
| Run | Same conditions as Install; add a note instead |
| Contributing | Never omit |

When omitting a section, replace it with a one-line note explaining why. This signals intent, not neglect.
