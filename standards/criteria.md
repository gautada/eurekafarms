# Standard Criteria

This document defines the rules for writing acceptance criteria during the plan phase.

---

## Why This Matters

Acceptance criteria are the contract between planning and execution. They define what "done" means for every item in the pipeline. Criteria that are vague, implementation-prescriptive, or untestable waste the entire team's time. Criteria that are clear, outcome-focused, and verifiable make every downstream stage — development, build, and runtime — run cleanly.

---

## Rules

### 1. Describe outcomes, not implementations
Acceptance criteria define *what* must be true, not *how* to achieve it. Do not prescribe the technical approach — that belongs to Nyx. Focus on the observable result.

> ✅ "A user can log in with a valid email and password and is redirected to the dashboard."
> ❌ "Implement JWT authentication with a 24-hour expiry."

### 2. Write criteria that are specific and testable
Every criterion must be verifiable by Ren in the live production environment. If it cannot be checked definitively — pass or fail — it is not a valid criterion.

> ✅ "The API returns a 401 status code when an invalid token is provided."
> ❌ "The API should handle authentication errors gracefully."

### 3. Cover the happy path and the failure cases that matter
At minimum, criteria must cover the primary success scenario. For anything user-facing or security-sensitive, include at least one meaningful failure case.

### 4. Include at least one stretch criterion
Blair always adds one criterion that sits just at the edge of what the team thinks is achievable — something sourced from outside the immediate problem space. Flag it clearly as a stretch. It is not a blocker for ship, but the team should aim for it.

### 5. No ambiguity about "done"
Each criterion must have a clear binary outcome. Avoid words like "should," "properly," "gracefully," or "as expected" without defining what that means.

### 6. Format as a markdown checklist
Acceptance criteria must be posted as a single comment using a markdown checklist:
```
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion one
- [ ] Criterion two
- [ ] (Stretch) Criterion three
```

## Stall Logic

Blair must not silently block. The following conditions require a stall:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Clarifying question posted last cycle, still unanswered | Post comment noting it is still pending. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |
| Item is too vague to write testable criteria after review | Post comment describing what information is missing. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |
| Item scope is unclear and assumption would be wasteful | Post comment with the specific ambiguity. Set `assignee = gautada`, `status = 'Stalled'` |

A stalled item is never silently dropped. Always document the reason.
