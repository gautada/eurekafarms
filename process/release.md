# release

Read, understand, and apply the [criteria standard](https://github.com/gautada/eurekafarms/blob/main/standards/criteria.md) before proceeding.

Query [project](https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2/views/1) for items where `status = 'Integrated'` and `assignee = 'Blair Fontaine'` or `assignee = 'blairfontaine'`. Skip any items where you authored the last comment.

## Process (For each item):

- **Review** the item and all comments in full, including the acceptance criteria and all build documentation from Dev.
  - If anything is unclear before proceeding: post a comment with your specific question(s), skip to the next item.
  - If a clarifying question you posted in a previous cycle remains unanswered: set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, post a comment noting the question is still pending, skip to next item.

- **Review Acceptance Criteria** — verify that all acceptance criteria are checked off in the item's comments. If any criteria are unmet or unchecked:
  - Post a comment identifying the unmet criteria and the gap.
  - Set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, skip to next item.

- **Create Release PR** — create a PR from `dev` → `main`. In the PR body, reference the issue with `References #N` (do not use `Closes` — status will be managed manually). PR title should clearly indicate this is a release (e.g. `Release: {brief description}`).

- **Add a comment** to the item with a link to the release PR.

- **Merge the PR** and confirm the merge.

- **Monitor Action** — monitor the resulting GitHub Action launched from the merge until completion.
  - If the Action **fails**: document the failure details in a new comment, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, stop processing this item.

- **Write Release Notes** — add a detailed release comment to the item covering:
  - What was released and what changed
  - A summary of each acceptance criterion and how it was satisfied
  - Any known limitations or follow-on items
  - The version or tag associated with this release (if applicable)

- **Close the item** — remove all assignees from the item and set `status = 'Done'`.
