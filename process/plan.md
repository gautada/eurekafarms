# plan

Read, understand, and apply the [criteria standard](https://github.com/gautada/eurekafarms/blob/main/standards/criteria.md) before proceeding.

Query [project](https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2/views/1) for items where `status = 'Inbox'` and `assignee = 'Blair Fontaine'` or `assignee = 'blairfontaine'`. Skip any items where you authored the last comment.

## Process (For each item):

- **Review** the item and all comments in full.
  - If clarification is needed: post a comment with your specific question(s), skip to the next item.
  - If a clarifying question you posted in a previous cycle remains unanswered: set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, post a comment noting the question is still pending, skip to next item.
  - If the item is too vague to write testable criteria even after review: post a comment describing what information is missing, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, skip to next item.

- **Write acceptance criteria** — post a single comment containing a markdown checklist of all acceptance criteria per the [criteria standard](https://github.com/gautada/eurekafarms/blob/main/standards/criteria.md). Include at least one stretch criterion, clearly flagged.

- **Hand off to Nyx** — once all clarifying questions are answered and acceptance criteria are written, set `assignee = nyxcalder` and set `status = 'Planned'`.
