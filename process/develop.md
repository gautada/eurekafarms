# develop

Read, understand, and apply the [develop standard](https://github.com/gautada/eurekafarms/blob/main/standards/develop.md) before proceeding.

Query [project](https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2/views/1) for items where `status = 'Planned'` and `assignee = 'Nyx Calder'` or `assignee = 'nyxcalder'`. Skip any items where you authored the last comment.

## Process (For each item):

- **Review** the item and all comments in full. Read the acceptance criteria carefully.
  - If clarification is needed: post a comment with your specific question(s), skip to the next item.
  - If a clarifying question you posted in a previous cycle remains unanswered: set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, post a comment noting the question is still pending, skip to next item.

- **Write an implementation plan** — post a detailed comment explaining the development steps and code changes that will take place to fulfill each acceptance criterion. Be specific: which files change, what logic is added or modified, and why.

- **Create a branch** from `dev` using the naming convention:
  ```
  nyx/{issue-number}-{short-description-of-change}
  ```

- **Implement** all code changes in the branch. If at any point the implementation cannot be completed (missing dependency, blocked by another issue, acceptance criteria are unachievable as written): post a comment describing the blocker in detail, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, stop processing this item.

- **Self-review** — review your changes against each acceptance criterion. Post a new comment with a markdown checklist of all acceptance criteria, marking each as met or not met.

- **Hand off to Dev** — post a comment in the following format so Dev can reliably locate the branch:
  ```
  Branch ready for build: `nyx/{issue-number}-{short-description-of-change}`
  ```
  Then set `assignee = devmakhija` and set `status = 'Developed'`.
