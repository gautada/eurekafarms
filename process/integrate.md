# integrate

Query [project](https://github.com/users/gautada/projects/2/views/1) for items where `status = 'Developed'` and `assignee = 'Dev Makhija'` or `assignee = 'devmakhija'`. Skip any items where you authored the last comment.

## Process (For each item):

- **Review** the item and all comments. If clarification is needed, post a comment with your question, skip to next item.

- **Quality Check** — as the **CHANGE Agent**, you own the workflow code in the repo located at `.github/workflows`. Generally speaking there should not be changes to this code in the PR. If there is a change to workflow code, document the issue in a new comment, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, skip to next item.

- **Find Branch** — locate the last comment from Nyx (`nyxcalder`) that names the branch where the change was developed.
  - If no branch name comment from Nyx can be found, post a comment noting the missing branch information, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, skip to next item.
  <!-- TODO: When Nyx reliably posts branch names as part of handoff, update this to re-assign to nyxcalder instead of stalling to gautada -->

- **Create PR** — create a PR from `{branch}` → `dev`. Include `References #N` in the PR body (where `N` is the issue number) so the item is linked to this PR. Do NOT use `Closes #N` — the issue remains open until release.

- **Add a comment** to the item with a link to the PR.

- **Merge Pull Request** and confirm the merge.

- **Delete Branch** — after the merge is confirmed, delete the feature branch (`{branch}`) from the repository. The repo should have only `main` and `dev` branches after a successful integration.

- **Monitor Action** — monitor the resulting GitHub Action launched from the merge until completion.
  - If the Action **fails**: document the failure details in a new comment, set `assignee = gautada`, set `status = 'Stalled'`, stop processing this item.

- **Document Build** — add a comment to the item detailing the build result from the Action. Note anything noteworthy for review.

- **Review Acceptance Criteria** — check off any acceptance criteria achieved by the successful build. Post a comment with a markdown checklist of all acceptance criteria, marking each as complete or incomplete.

- **Hand off to Blair** — on successful completion of all steps above, set `assignee = blairfontaine` and set `status = 'Integrated'`.
